   abstract = {Background: Amplicon sequencing of phylogenetic marker genes, e.g., 16S, 18S, or ITS ribosomal RNA sequences, is still the most commonly used method to determine the composition of microbial communities. Microbial ecologists often have expert knowledge on their biological question and data analysis in general, and most research institutes have computational infrastructures to use the bioinformatics command line tools and workflows for amplicon sequencing analysis, but requirements of bioinformatics skills often limit the efficient and up-to-date use of computational resources. Results: We present dadasnake, a user-friendly, 1-command Snakemake pipeline that wraps the preprocessing of sequencing reads and the delineation of exact sequence variants by using the favorably benchmarked and widely used DADA2 algorithm with a taxonomic classification and the post-processing of the resultant tables, including hand-off in standard formats. The suitability of the provided default configurations is demonstrated using mock community data from bacteria and archaea, as well as fungi. Conclusions: By use of Snakemake, dadasnake makes efficient use of high-performance computing infrastructures. Easy user configuration guarantees flexibility of all steps, including the processing of data from multiple sequencing platforms. It is easy to install dadasnake via conda environments. dadasnake is available at https://github.com/a-h-b/dadasnake.},

It is the first system to support the use of automatically inferred multiple named wildcards (or variables) in input and output filenames.\n\nAVAILABILITY: http://snakemake.googlecode.com.\n\nCONTACT: johannes.koester@uni-due.de.},

@article{Koster2021,
   abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},
